## Overview

BioImageSuiteLite is a user-friendly desktop application designed for biologists and researchers to analyze time-lapse microscopy data. It simplifies the entire workflow from data import to results export, enabling rapid, reproducible analysis of cellular events.

The tool provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built on the powerful [Napari](https://napari.org/) viewer, allowing users to:

- **Load Data:** Directly import `.avi` files or multi-page `.tif`/`.tiff` stacks.
- **Define Regions of Interest (ROIs):** Interactively draw multiple ROIs to focus analysis on specific areas.
- **Process & Segment:** Apply Difference of Gaussians (DoG) filtering for feature enhancement and use Otsu's method for robust, automated segmentation.
- **Analyze & Visualize:** Automatically calculate and plot event frequency, intensity dynamics, and other key metrics over time.
- **Export Results:** Save analysis data (e.g., events per second per area) to `.csv` files for further analysis and plotting.

## Installation

We recommend installing BioImageSuiteLite into a dedicated virtual environment.

### 1. Simple Installation (Recommended)

Install the package directly using pip:

```bash
# It is recommended to create a virtual environment first
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install from PyPI
pip install bioimagesuitelite
```

### 2. To install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

For the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/InnovationLine/BioImageSuiteLite.git
```

## Quick Start

1. **Launch the application:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt (with the virtual environment activated) and run:
   ```bash
   bioimagesuitelite
   ```
2. **Load Data:**
   Click the **"Load File"** button to open your microscopy data (`.avi` or `.tif`/`.tiff`).
3. **Draw an ROI:**
   Select the **Polygon tool** from the Napari layer controls (top left) and draw one or more regions around the cells you want to analyze.
4. **Run Analysis:**
   Adjust parameters in the GUI dock widget as needed (e.g., Gaussian sigma, thresholding method). Click the **"Run Analysis"** button to start processing.
5. **Explore Results:**
   View the generated plots for event traces and intensity profiles. Use the **"Save Data"** button to export your quantitative results to a CSV file.

For a detailed reference, see the full [User Guide](./UserGuide.md).
